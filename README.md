# Association-Rule-Mining

Mining association rules and frequent item sets allows for the discovery of interesting and useful connections or relationships between items.

In this project, Apriori and FP-growth algorithms are used to mine association rules from a sample retail market basket data set.
The results are then evaluated based on several interest measures (lift, IR, Kulc).

# Objective

The objectives of the study are the following:
- to obtain association rules and analyze them for better decision support,
better understanding of data, or increasing company prot using
the Apriori Algorithm and FP-Growth Algorithm
- to analyze association rules based on relevance, interestingness, and
correlation, and use lift, Imbalance Ratio (IR), and Kulczynski (Kulc)
measure as correlation measures.

# Methodology
A comprehensive description of the methodologies used is discussed in `report.pdf`.

# Conclusions
Generally, we would want to obtain high-confidence, high-correlation
rules.  Using information, companies could
benefit by sending coupons or discounts for a given item to customers who
are likely to purchase that item. For rules with low imbalance ratio and
high support, it may also be advantageous to
place these items near each other in a supermarket setting since customers
are likely to purchase them together
